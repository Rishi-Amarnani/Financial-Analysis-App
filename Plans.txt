//----------taking input and storing it---------------//
//allow user to enter purchases
//store purchases in array then feed into text file or excel doc

//allow user to enter current jobs and salaries
//store in array then into text file/excel doc

//keep track of total spending
//keep track of date which spending was added

//-----------average spending over pd of time-----------//
//find the difference between when a purchase was made
//and today to compute how many days it has been
//use the total spending and this number of days
//to figure out the average spending per days, per week, per month

//-----------average spending split into two categories----//
//Generally there will be two categories
//1. days where you spend a small amount (average day)
//2. days where you spend alot (party days, holidays, weekends, etc)

//split the average spending into these two categories
//and for each unit of time give two statistics:
//for example: 1. What is the average spending on a normal day over a month
//			   2. What is the avg spending on a special day over a month
//


//----------Line graph------------//
//Plot this average spending per day/month/year onto a line graph


//---------Pie chart--------------//
//For both special days and average days,
//figure out what is the distribution of spending
//ex: special day: 40% food 30% alcohol 30% movie
//	  normal day: 60% food 40% coffee
//and display this data in a pie chart

//Can be calculated for a day over a month, week or year
//--> TO SEE what the average day looks like over that time span

//can be done for a week over a month or year
//where we show the pie chart for monday through sunday
//and each monday is an average of all mondays over that month
//or year or greater


//maybe ever add comparisons
//like what was the average day or week like in 2014 vs 2015


//-----------Savings------------//
//can compute savings for every week or month -- and display in line chart
//or compute average savings a week or month over a year 

//---------Voice recognition----------//
//after you figure out all the calculations
//and figure out the graphing
//check out voice recognition libraries and APIs.
